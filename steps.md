# STEPS TO TAKE, BEFORE BUILDING THIS CALCULATOR.
    - Add the basic stylings, such as the box model and display properties, to make it look exactly like the original design.
    - Start to add the color styles, to make the calculator more appealing to the users.
    - Adjust buttons and make them look more alike to the original one.
    - Start Computational coding (The Logic behind the calculator) (using Javascript).
    - Finish up styling and add themes changing as the user clicks on his / her preferred terms.
    - Test to see if calculator is working properly, and also giving expected results.
    - Design and build it up for mobile and tablet responsiveness.
    - Test and debug again.
    -Deploy as complete project, and ready to use.

    <!-- THE KEYBOARD SHOULD BE USEFUL (and active), WHEN I CLICK ON THEM, TO PERFORM COMPUTATIONS. -->
    <!-- THE KEYBOARD SHOULD ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE PARTICULAR KEY CLICKED ON, WHEN I CLICK ON THE KEY ON THE KEYBOARD (do this, using keypress) -->
